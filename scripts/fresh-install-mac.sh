The app is a menu-bar agent (LSUIElement), so it has no Dock icon — look for
it in the menu bar. Grant Microphone and Accessibility permissions when macOS
asks; without Accessibility, paste-at-cursor cannot work.

First launch downloads the Whisper model. The default is now large-v3-turbo
(~1.6GB), so give it a minute before the first dictation.
