# Changelog

All notable changes to WhisperWoof will be documented in this file.
WhisperWoof is a fork of OpenWhispr — see below for inherited changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **A polish model's inline deliberation can no longer reach your pasted text.** Observed with Qwen3.5 2B: a dictation came back as the cleaned sentence plus 300 characters of the model discussing whether a word was a typo ("注：原文中…修正后：…"). `<think>`-stripping and `enable_thinking: false` already existed, but plain-text commentary passes both. A deterministic guard now compares every polish result against the raw transcript — output that balloons past 2x (+60 chars) or contains meta-markers the user never said ("注：", "修正后：", "here is the cleaned"…) is rejected and the raw transcript pastes instead. Applied on all three polish surfaces (live dictation, History retry, Cmd+K command bar), with the production leak itself as a regression test. `src/whisperwoof/core/polish/polish-output-guard.ts` (+9 tests). Extended same-day with two more production-observed failure modes: whole-sentence translation (raw "Pizzo,你知不知道你的手机可不可以用eSIM?" came back in pure English — caught by a language-composition check: a mostly-Han input can never return with almost no Han characters, and vice versa) and roleplay emotes (a reply that is just `*punch*` when no asterisk was dictated). Spoken punctuation words (星号 etc.) are exempted from the ratio so "星号 punch 星号" still legitimately becomes `*punch*`. Extended again for **partial** translation — one clause flipped while the rest survives ("我们明天要 review 这个 pull request 然后再决定要不要 merge" → "我们明天要 review this pull request and then decide whether to merge") never collapsed the whole-sentence ratio, and short utterances ("好的谢谢" → "Okay, thanks") were skipped as too little signal. Cleanup can legitimately *drop* letters of either script (fillers, self-corrections, spoken punctuation, 三百块 → 300元) but has no reason to drop one script while growing the other in proportion — translating N Han characters yields ~2-3N Latin letters — so that combination is now rejected too, both directions, with the short-input floor lowered from 6 letters to 2 (+10 tests covering the leaks and the cleanups that must still pass).
- **Home stats and History now refresh in real time.** Dictation runs in the overlay window while Home/History live in the control panel, and nothing told them a new entry existed — counts sat at 0 until a remount. The main process now broadcasts `whisperwoof-entry-saved` after each save, both views subscribe, and window focus refetches as a catch-all.

### Changed
- **The Fn hotkey is now hold-to-talk with a double-tap latch (Wispr-Flow style).** Hold Fn, speak, release — the transcript pastes, exactly as before. New: double-tap Fn to latch recording on hands-free, then tap once to stop and paste; a stray single tap cancels quietly instead of pasting a 150ms blip. The latency-critical property is preserved by construction: only presses shorter than 250ms enter the 300ms double-tap window, so a normal hold's release still stops and processes immediately, with zero added latency — and because recording starts 75ms after the FIRST press, a latch loses none of the opening words. Implemented as a pure, fully unit-tested state machine (`src/helpers/fnActivationMachine.js`, 18 timing-path tests); right-side modifier hotkeys (e.g. RightOption) get the same behavior. Fn+letter combo routing is unchanged.
- **…and it works in both activation modes, not just "Hold".** The first cut only engaged the machine when the activation mode was "push", but "Tap" is the default everywhere (renderer store, main's `.env` reader, the window-manager cache) and the renderer's startup sync forces main's value — so on a Mac that never touched the setting, Fn still went to the old toggle and the new behavior never appeared. The machine now drives Fn in both modes; the setting only decides what a lone single tap means. **Tap:** tap to start, tap again to stop — and hold-to-talk and double-tap-to-lock come for free. **Hold:** hold to talk, double-tap to lock; a stray tap is discarded. The mode is read per press so a settings change applies on the next key-down; switching modes mid-latch finishes the recording (your words paste); hotkey capture keeps the machine out of the loop. The Tap/Hold descriptions in all 10 locales now say what each mode does.

### Fixed (updater)
- **No more "update available" prompts on builds that could never install one.** Every macOS build this fork produces is unsigned (`fresh-install-mac.sh`, `ci.yml` and `release.yml` all pass `--config.mac.identity=null`), and macOS refuses to auto-install an unsigned app — so "Update Now" could only ever download ~200MB and fail, while the prompt came back 3s after every launch and every four hours. Builds now stamp `whisperwoofUpdateMode` into their `package.json` via electron-builder's `extraMetadata`: **`off`** for local (`fresh-install-mac.sh`) and CI test builds — no checks at all, Settings shows a "Local build" badge — and **`manual`** for releases, where the prompt's button opens the GitHub release page for a drag-in install instead of a download that cannot finish. The local script also stamps the `VERSION` file's number so About matches. Two further causes of phantom prompts fixed underneath: electron-updater's per-arch channel setter silently turns on `allowDowngrade` (any version *difference* counted as an update — now off), and a failed *background* check (offline, a release without a channel yml) was forwarded as `update-error`, which Settings turned into an "Update Error" alert on every mount — background failures now only log; errors from something you clicked still surface. The prompt gains a **Skip** that persists the version (`SKIPPED_UPDATE_VERSION` in the user `.env`), so a re-check never resurrects it while a newer version still shows. Decisions live in `src/whisperwoof/bridge/update-policy-pure.js` (+11 tests). `release.yml` now also publishes `latest-arm64-mac.yml` so release builds can actually see new versions.

### Added
- **History → Regenerate: re-run any dictation through a different transcription model and/or cleanup model.** Every entry now keeps the link to the recording it came from (`metadata.transcriptionId`, the upstream row that owns the audio file; older entries are matched by exact text + timestamp the first time the panel opens). The panel offers every Whisper / Parakeet / SenseVoice / Nemotron model that is actually downloaded and runnable (the parakeet status check used to stat a transducer file SenseVoice does not have, so SenseVoice showed as "not downloaded" — fixed), and every downloaded local cleanup model plus "None (raw transcript)" and the cloud cleanup when signed in. Transcription runs in the main process on the stored audio; cleanup runs through the same ReasoningService + output guard as live dictation, minus the 25-char skip and 3s timeout. The result replaces the entry (the linked upstream row too, so Home agrees), the previous text is kept for **Undo** (10 deep), and the header shows which models produced the current text. Decisions live in `src/whisperwoof/bridge/regenerate-entry-pure.js` (+25 tests) and `src/whisperwoof/ui/history/regenerate-selections.ts` (+11 tests).
- **Polish eval can target the bundled engine.** `LLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 node eval/run-polish-eval.js` sends exactly what the app sends to llama-server (prompt, directive, script hint, sampling, `enable_thinking:false`), so the shipped GGUF is what gets measured instead of an Ollama proxy.

### Fixed (retry)
- **The upstream "Re-transcribe" button's Whisper path could never work.** It listed `<userData>/models` (Whisper models live under the cache root) and then passed a file path where `transcribeLocalWhisper` requires a registry id. It now asks the Whisper manager which models are downloaded and passes the id, falling back to the best downloaded model. `resolveRetryWhisperModel` in `retry-transcription-pure.js` (+5 tests).

## [1.16.0] - 2026-08-24 — Reliable zh/en transcription: turbo default, script fix, working retry, Nemotron streaming + SenseVoice

### Fixed
- **The cleanup prompt no longer lets the polish model translate embedded English into Chinese.** Neither the en nor the zh prompts said anything about preserving the input's language mix, and production selects the prompt by UI language — so a zh-CN user's mixed dictation ran under all-Chinese instructions, which small local models read as license to "normalize" the English into Chinese. All three prompts (en/zh-CN/zh-TW) now carry an explicit never-translate rule: every word stays in the language it was spoken in. The polish eval gains five zh/en code-switching cases (its 15 existing cases contained no Chinese at all) and a `LOCALE=zh-CN` switch so the prompt users actually get is the one measured. `src/locales/*/prompts.json`, `eval/polish-cases.json`, `eval/run-polish-eval.js`.
- **The auto-updater no longer offers to replace WhisperWoof with upstream OpenWhispr.** `updater.js` still pointed its feed at `OpenWhispr/openwhispr` — inherited from the fork — so installed copies checked upstream's releases and could surface upstream versions (e.g. "1.8.3 is ready to download") as updates. Accepting one would have installed a different product over this app. The feed now matches this repo's `electron-builder.json` publish coordinates.
- **Retry-transcription was broken for Whisper and always claimed no model was downloaded.** The handler read a `getSettings()` that does not exist in the Electron main process; the `ReferenceError` was swallowed by a bare `catch`, leaving the model path null, so every Whisper retry returned "No Whisper model downloaded. Go to Settings → Transcription to download a model, then retry." — with models sitting on disk. Retry now takes the engine, model and language from the caller (settings live in the renderer store, so the main process cannot read them). `src/helpers/ipcHandlers.js`, `src/whisperwoof/bridge/retry-transcription-pure.js` (+ unit tests).
- **Retry no longer sends Chinese audio to Parakeet.** It tried Parakeet first whenever its server was up, ignoring the configured engine — but Parakeet TDT has no CJK coverage, so retrying a Chinese recording returned empty. Retry now applies the same language guard `audioManager.processAudio` applies to live dictation.
- **Dictation no longer returns Traditional characters for Simplified speech.** Whisper's auto-detection selects a language (`zh`), never a script, and `getBaseLanguageCode` drops the `-CN`/`-TW` suffix before the request is built, so nothing downstream knows which script the user writes. Measured on real human audio (`eval/dictation-bench`): whisper-small returns `開放時間早上9點至下午5點`. Output is now normalized to Simplified unless the dictation language is `zh-TW`/`zh-HK`. Applied on all seven transcript paths — local Whisper, local Parakeet, the OpenAI/Mistral/OpenWhispr-cloud batch paths, the local fallback, and streaming — so the script cannot change with the engine. `src/whisperwoof/bridge/chinese-script.js` (+ unit tests).
- **…and the script fix now actually ships in the packaged app.** The first cut shared one CommonJS module between the renderer and the main process — but Vite only applies its CommonJS transform to `node_modules`, so the production bundle carried a literal `require("opencc-js/t2cn")` and a bare `module.exports`, which throws the moment the chunk loads (the renderer runs with `nodeIntegration: false`, so there is no `require` to fall back on). Dev mode and Vitest both transform CJS, which is why every test stayed green around it. The renderer now has a true ES-module implementation (`core/language/normalize-chinese-script.ts`) that Vite bundles with the ~49KB dictionary, the main process keeps its CJS copy (`bridge/chinese-script.js`), and a parity suite (`chinese-script-parity.test.ts`) runs every behavioral case through both copies so they cannot drift.
- **…and the Simplified default no longer tramples Traditional-script users on `auto`.** The first cut resolved `auto` to Simplified unconditionally — correct for Simplified speakers, silently wrong for a zh-TW/zh-HK user on the recommended auto setting. The script is now resolved from the user's own signals, most specific first: dictation language, then the app's UI language, then the OS locale, and only then the Simplified majority default. The retry path passes the renderer-resolved script over IPC so a re-run applies the same script as live dictation. `resolveChineseScript` in `core/language/normalize-chinese-script.ts` (+ unit tests).

### Changed
- **The default Whisper model is now large-v3-turbo, not small.** Measured on the app's real capture path with zh/en code-switching speech: turbo 24.8% mixed error rate vs small 34.9%, and small leaks Traditional characters where turbo does not. Costs 1.6GB on disk against 0.5GB. The model advisor already preferred turbo on machines with the RAM for it, so the default and the recommendation now agree. `src/stores/settingsStore.ts`.

### Removed
- **Voice editing commands, which hijacked dictation.** Every capture ran a regex check before polish and paste, and a match (`^translate … (to|into) `, `^make (this|that|it) `, `^(summarize|tldr) `, …) read the clipboard and posted it to `http://localhost:11434` — an Ollama endpoint this app stopped shipping. So a sentence merely *starting* like a command cost a failed round-trip before landing, and on a machine that happened to run Ollama it was replaced outright by a rewrite of the clipboard. The feature was on by default with no UI toggle anywhere (the only way to disable it was setting `whisperwoof-voice-commands` in localStorage by hand), and its detection was the sole consumer of the module — `whisperwoofGetVoiceCommands` was never called by any UI. Removed the interception, the three IPC handlers, the preload bridges and the bridge module. Historical `routed_to` values with the `voice-command:` prefix still render in analytics.

### Added
- **Live local streaming dictation (NVIDIA Nemotron).** Two new local models — Nemotron 3.5 Streaming (15 languages, auto language detection) and Nemotron Streaming EN — decode as you speak: partial text appears live in the floating indicator, and on release the already-committed transcript replaces the batch decode entirely, so the result lands near-instantly. The engine layer (dual offline/online sherpa websocket runtime, sidecar PID reaping, streaming accumulator, sherpa-onnx 1.13.4 with the macOS arm64 codesign fix) is ported from upstream OpenWhispr; the renderer integration is WhisperWoof's own and rides the existing partial-transcript indicator. The batch recording keeps running in parallel, so an unclean streaming flush falls back to today's batch decode with nothing lost. Chinese is not in Nemotron's language set — pinned-zh dictation is routed to Whisper exactly like Parakeet is today.
- **SenseVoice as a local engine option — the best measured choice for zh/en mixed speech.** Measured through the app's real engine path (server, silence gate and websocket protocol included): 20.0% mixed error rate vs Whisper Turbo's 24.8% at roughly 5x the speed (RTF 0.063 on 4 CPU threads), with Simplified Chinese and punctuation built into the model. 155MB download covering zh/en/ja/ko/yue. Retry and live dictation both know its language coverage, so Chinese now stays on the sherpa engine when SenseVoice is selected instead of being rerouted to Whisper.
- **`scripts/fresh-install-mac.sh` — wipe every installed copy and build a fresh one.** Quits the app, removes the bundle from `/Applications`, `~/Applications`, `~/Downloads` and `~/Desktop`, ejects mounted DMGs, and rebuilds the Launch Services database so no ghost icon survives — then builds unsigned arm64 the same way CI does and installs it. Dictation history and downloaded models are kept unless `--purge-data` is passed. `--clean-only` skips the build.
- **`eval/dictation-bench` — a zh/en code-switching bench for the local STT path.** The Vitest suite covers `src/whisperwoof/core/` side-features and touched none of the dictation path. This measures the text itself, feeding audio through the real capture path (MediaRecorder webm/opus stereo → `ffmpegUtils.convertToWav` 16k mono) rather than clean WAVs, and re-checking the decisive cases on human recordings so no conclusion rests on TTS artifacts.

## [1.15.6] - 2026-07-03 — Truthful privacy pill + canonical local provider setting

### Fixed
- **The home-screen Cleanup pill no longer claims "sent to the cloud" for an on-device model.** Same root cause as the v1.15.4 prewarm bug: picking a local model stored the model *family* ("qwen", "llama", …) in the reasoning-provider setting, and the pill only showed "On-device" for exactly `"local"` — so local users saw a cloud icon and "sent to the cloud" on their own machine's model. This release fixes it at the source: the Settings picker now always stores the canonical `"local"`, a one-time migration cleans up existing installs (the v1.15.4 sync-boundary normalization stays as a safety net for old settings backups), and the pill accepts legacy values. `src/components/ReasoningModelSelector.tsx`, `src/components/ModelStatusBar.tsx`, `src/stores/settingsStore.ts`, `src/whisperwoof/core/settings/local-reasoning-provider.ts` (+ unit tests for every family id, the migration, and tab resolution).
- **The Cleanup pill now shows "Cloud" when signed-in OpenWhispr cloud cleanup is active.** Cloud mode routes polish to OpenWhispr regardless of the local model settings, but the pill previously read only the local provider setting — a signed-in user with a local model configured saw a lock icon while transcripts went to the cloud. The pill now keys on the effective routing.
- **Switching Cleanup from Cloud back to Local no longer forgets your model family.** Entering local mode used to overwrite the remembered picker tab with the default (Qwen) and could clear a working model selection; the remembered family is now resolved before anything is written.

### Changed
- **The local model picker's family tab is remembered per picker.** The dictation cleanup picker and the agent-mode picker each keep their own last-used family tab instead of silently sharing (and overwriting) one another's.

## [1.15.5] - 2026-07-02 — Health pass: crash fix, KDE guide fix, real CI gates

### Fixed
- **Creating a custom capture template no longer crashes when a section has no id.** The template's output-format fallback referenced an undeclared loop index, throwing `ReferenceError: i is not defined` the moment it ran. `src/whisperwoof/bridge/entry-templates.js`.
- **KDE Wayland users can now actually see the xclip setup guide.** The Settings paste-diagnostics panel stored the guide under a `guide` key while the dialog reads `steps`, so clicking the xclip check opened an empty guide. Also adds a step description. `src/components/SettingsPage.tsx`.
- **All 11 TypeScript errors cleared** — typed unwraps for CJS test imports, missing optional callback keys in the agent overlay, a JSON-cast fix in the model registry, and one `Window.electronAPI` declaration instead of two conflicting ones.

### Changed
- **CI's "Lint & Typecheck" job can now actually fail.** Both steps were wrapped in `|| true`, so the job was green no matter what — which is how 11 type errors and a lint config break sat unnoticed on main. Typecheck now enforces; lint stays soft until 24 newly-unmasked react-hooks errors are fixed. Plugins lint as ESM. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `eslint.config.js`.

## [1.15.4] - 2026-07-02 — Dictation polish reliability fix

### Fixed
- **Dictation cleanup silently stopped running after picking a local AI model in Settings.** Selecting a local model wrote the model *family* name ("qwen", "llama", …) into the reasoning-provider setting, but the app only pre-warms — and keeps alive — the local cleanup engine when that setting is exactly `"local"`. The mismatch skipped the boot pre-warm and actively shut the engine down on every settings sync, so every dictation shipped the raw transcript with no polish and no warning. Provider family ids are now normalized to `"local"` at the sync boundary, so pre-warm fires at boot and the engine stays warm; cloud providers are untouched. `src/hooks/useSettings.ts`, `src/whisperwoof/core/settings/startup-reasoning-prefs.ts` (+ unit tests covering every family id, cloud passthrough, and the "openai" vs "openai-oss" distinction).

## [1.15.3] - 2026-06-30 — Reliable multilingual dictation + clearer model picker

### Fixed
- **Chinese (and other non-English) dictation no longer comes out as English.** When a custom dictionary or vocabulary pack was set, the app fed those words to Whisper as a decode "initial prompt." An all-English word list biases Whisper's language detection, so on Chinese speech it transcribed (and effectively translated) the audio into English — even when the dictation language was auto. The dictionary prompt is now skipped in auto-detect mode and only applied when a specific dictation language is pinned, where the hint is scoped and safe. English-pinned users keep the dictionary benefit. Verified end-to-end on real recordings: same clip went from English garbage to correct Chinese once the prompt was withheld. `src/helpers/audioManager.js`.
- **Dictating in a non-English language no longer comes back translated to English.** The bundled local cleanup model (Qwen 2B) was biased toward English by the all-English cleanup prompt and its examples, so it intermittently *translated* non-English speech instead of just cleaning it — Chinese dictation, for instance, came back as English. The same-language hint was a single weak line appended at the very end of the prompt, which the small model under-weighted. The fix hoists one short rule — "Output in the same language as the input. Never translate." — to the very top of the cleanup prompt (cleanup mode only; agent-mode "translate this to X" still works, and custom prompts are untouched). Measured on a qwen2.5:3b proxy, Chinese-preserved went from ~2/6 to ~6/6 with English dictation unaffected. `src/config/prompts.ts`.
- **Chinese dictation now uses real full-width punctuation with consistent spacing.** Cleanup output is normalized so 句号/逗号 land as full-width `。，？！：；` with a single space after each, instead of stray half-width `.`/`,` or cramped spacing. It runs as a deterministic post-process on the transcript (`normalizeCjkPunctuation`), so it costs the model nothing and only touches punctuation adjacent to a Han character — decimals (`3.14`), times (`5:30`), emails, and URLs are left alone, and English output is untouched. Wired into the dictation path (Whisper + Parakeet + fallback). `src/whisperwoof/core/language/normalize-cjk-punctuation.ts`, `src/helpers/audioManager.js`.

### Changed
- **The speech-to-text model picker now explains each model.** Every model shows a one-line description of its real tradeoffs (speed, accuracy, multilingual support) — and the English-only "Distil" models now carry a clear ⚠️ warning that they turn Chinese and other languages into English. These descriptions existed in the data but were never rendered. `src/components/TranscriptionModelPicker.tsx`, locale files.
- **History shows the original transcript next to the cleaned one by default.** When cleanup changed the text, the home list now expands the raw transcript inline instead of hiding it behind a hover-and-click, so you can see what you actually said versus the polished result. `src/components/ui/TranscriptionItem.tsx`.

## [1.15.2] - 2026-06-14 — Remove dead Ollama-only modules

### Removed
- **Cut 8 unused Ollama-era feature modules and their wiring (~3,100 lines).** These bridge modules were scaffolding from the legacy WhisperWoof Ollama experiment: each was reachable only through an IPC handler with no renderer caller, so none ran in the shipping app. Removed `auto-tagger`, `semantic-search`, `backtrack`, `intent-capture`, `conversation-memory`, `daily-digest`, `smart-reply`, and `screen-context` — including their `ipcHandlers.js` handlers, `preload.js` bindings, `src/types/electron.ts` declarations, the `daily-digest`/`semantic-search` DB-init blocks in `app-init.js`, and their tests. The separate tag CRUD (`whisperwoof-get-tags` etc.), voice-commands, and agentic-actions are untouched.
- **Home no longer pings a local LLM for a "fun insight."** `HomeStats` made an Ollama/llama call to generate a one-line observation; it's gone. The static fun facts (streaks, busiest hour, voice %) stay.

## [1.15.1] - 2026-06-14 — Floating indicator fixes

### Fixed
- **The waveform no longer animates when you're not talking.** Voice-activity detection used a flat RMS threshold (0.005) that sat below many microphones' ambient noise floor, so the indicator "waved" constantly even in silence. It now uses hysteresis — start at a clear voice level (0.02), hold until it drops below 0.012 — so it reacts to your voice, not room noise.
- **Mando's head shows again during dictation.** The floating panel was 140px tall and the indicator is bottom-anchored, so in the taller "speaking" layout the head (topmost element) was clipped off the top — you saw the waveform but not the dog. The panel is now tall enough (188px) to keep the head visible. (Compounded by the always-on waveform bug above, which held the panel in its tallest layout.)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-06-10 — Local Polish: Tuned, On by Default, Legacy Stack Removed

### Performance
- **Local polish was silently broken on the default model — fixed, ~16x faster.** The bundled/recommended local reasoning models (Qwen3.5 / Qwen3) default to "thinking" mode, so the cleanup call spent its entire 512-token budget emitting `<think>…` (~4 s, empty `content`) — which blew past `POLISH_TIMEOUT_MS` (3 s) and silently fell back to the raw transcript on every dictation. The polish path now sends `chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}` to llama-server (both the dictation non-streaming path in `llamaServer.js` and the streaming/CommandBar path in `ReasoningService.ts`). Measured on an M5 Pro with the bundled Qwen3.5-2B: **~245 ms vs ~4 s**, and it actually returns cleaned text. No-op for model templates that don't use `enable_thinking`.
- **Parakeet TDT 0.6b available as an opt-in fast STT (Whisper stays the default).** Measured local Whisper STT latency (M5 Pro, warm): base ~114 ms, turbo ~865 ms, large-v3 ~1155 ms for a 5 s clip — an 8–10x model-dependent swing. Parakeet TDT is a faster on-device transducer for English + 24 European languages, so it's offered as a speed option in Settings. It is **not** the default: it has no Chinese/CJK support, so defaulting to it would silently break multilingual users (Parakeet returns empty → a misleading "No audio detected"). Whisper (multilingual) remains the default. Profiling harness added: `eval/bench-stt.sh`.

### Fixed
- **Chinese (and other non-European) dictation no longer breaks under Parakeet.** Parakeet TDT only covers English + 24 European languages; speaking Chinese produced empty output surfaced as "No audio detected". Two fixes: (1) Whisper is the default again (multilingual), and (2) when Parakeet *is* selected but the chosen language isn't in its set, `audioManager` now auto-transcribes that capture with Whisper instead (`validateLanguageForModel`). A one-time migration moves anyone left on the brief Parakeet default back to Whisper.

### Fixed
- **Settings showed two STT models as "Active" at once.** The transcription picker marked the selected model "Active" per tab, and merely *clicking a provider tab silently switched the active provider* — so browsing Whisper ↔ Parakeet made each look active and could revert your choice without you touching a model. Tabs are now view-only (the active provider changes only when you pick a specific model), exactly one model is ever marked "Active", a guard stops browsing one tab from corrupting the other provider's saved model, and an authoritative "Active for dictation: …" caption sits under the tabs. `src/components/TranscriptionModelPicker.tsx`.

### Added
- **Active-model indicator on the home screen.** The main view now shows two at-a-glance pills — **Speech-to-text** and **Cleanup** — with the live model name, a one-line description, and a lock/cloud icon for on-device vs cloud. Click either to jump to its Settings section. Fixes the "what's actually running?" gap. `src/components/ModelStatusBar.tsx`.
- **Smart Cleanup is now set up during onboarding and on by default.** Polish (the filler-removal / grammar / formatting pass) was off by default and never surfaced in onboarding — so new users got raw transcription and never saw the feature, and the tuned `cleanupPrompt` never ran. The default comment even referenced the long-deleted Ollama path ("was adding 40s!"). Added a new onboarding step (Welcome → STT → **Smart Cleanup** → Permissions → Activation, `src/components/SmartCleanupStep.tsx`) that one-click downloads a recommended small local model (Qwen 2B, ~1.3 GB) via `useModelDownload` and enables local polish; fully skippable. Defaults flipped: `useReasoningModel` → `true`, `reasoningProvider` → `local` (local-first, consistent with `useLocalWhisper`). Until a model is downloaded the path no-ops cleanly (raw transcript), so existing users and skippers see no regression; boot prewarm (`sync-startup-preferences`) covers first-dictation latency.

### Removed
- **Removed the snippet subsystem** (Kanban board, Cmd+Shift+1-9 quick-paste hotkeys, voice trigger-phrase expansion, AI suggestions, analytics tracking, settings export). Its main surface — a Kanban board on the Clipboard tab — was replaced by the clipboard timeline, which orphaned the UI; rather than leave a large half-wired feature, the whole thing was cut (~13 files + the `bf_snippets`/`bf_snippet_boards` tables, IPC handlers, preload bridges, storage types/interface, and cross-cutting hooks in analytics/settings-export/main). The concept is preserved for a clean future rebuild in `docs/ideas/snippets.md`. 862 tests pass; build clean.
- **Deleted the "Voice Style" (TuningBench) feature and the entire legacy Ollama polish stack.** TuningBench was the last consumer keeping the legacy stack alive, and it tuned a pipeline that no longer ships — legacy presets via a separate Ollama install — rather than the production `cleanupPrompt` + llama-server path. Removed the UI (`src/whisperwoof/ui/tuning/`), its 7 IPC handlers + preload bridges + `electron.ts`/`api.ts` type decls, the "Voice Style" sidebar entry, and the now-unreachable `whisperwoof-get-providers` handler. Deleted the dead modules `tuning-bench.js`, `ollama-bridge.js`, `polish-presets.js`, `polish-presets-pure.js`, `llm-providers.js`, `core/polish/ollama-service.ts`, the `core/polish/{index,types}.ts` barrel (zero runtime importers), and the obsolete `eval/run-eval.js` (it benchmarked the legacy preset prompts, not the shipping prompt). Completes the deletion deferred in v1.13.0. Net −14 files; 905 tests pass; renderer builds clean.

### Changed
- **Clipboard tab is now a clipboard-activity timeline.** It previously showed a Kanban snippet board (boards/columns of reusable snippets) — not what most people expect from a "Clipboard" tab. It's now a condensed, card-based timeline of everything you've copied (`bf_entries` where `source = "clipboard"`), newest-first and grouped by day (Today / Yesterday / date). Click a card to re-copy, hover to delete, search to filter; text shows char count and any routing destination, images show dimensions. Backed by a new source-filtered query (`getWhisperWoofEntriesBySource` + `whisperwoof-get-entries-by-source`) so old clipboard items aren't buried under voice entries. `src/whisperwoof/ui/smart-clipboard/ClipboardTimeline.tsx`. (The old `SmartClipboard` Kanban board is now unwired — pending a decision on removing the snippet backend.)
- **Tuned the production dictation cleanup prompt for local models.** Measured the real `cleanupPrompt` (not the legacy presets the old eval tested) against local models on realistic raw-STT transcripts. Added three validated, regression-free rules: assemble spoken emails/URLs (`"john at acme dot com"` → `john@acme.com`), preserve the speaker's point of view (`"remind me to X"` no longer rewritten as a request to the reader), and fully resolve self-corrections (`"the blue one, no wait the green one"` → keep only green). Applied to `src/locales/en/prompts.json` and the synced `src/config/promptData.json`. New faithful eval harness lives in `eval/run-polish-eval.js` + `eval/polish-cases.json`.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-10 — STT Reliability + Transcription UX

### Fixes
- **Fixed broken `distil-large-v3.5` Whisper model download.** The registry entry (marked `recommended`) pointed at `distil-whisper/distil-large-v3.5-ggml/.../ggml-distil-large-v3.5.bin`, which 404s — selecting the model produced a failed download. Repointed `downloadUrl` to the repo's actual file (`ggml-model.bin`) and corrected the size metadata (claimed 756 MB → real 1.52 GB / 1519521155 bytes) so `validateFileSize` (10% tolerance, `downloadUtils.js:353`) no longer rejects the completed download. `fileName` (local save name) is unchanged. Verified the URL resolves (HTTP 206); an audit of all 36 registry model download URLs confirmed the other 35 (Whisper, Parakeet, and every local Qwen/Gemma/Llama/Mistral/GPT-OSS GGUF) are healthy.
- **Auto-paste now prompts for macOS Accessibility instead of silently failing.** When a paste needed Accessibility but it wasn't granted, the paste path checked silently (`isTrustedAccessibilityClient(false)`, `clipboard.js`) and only threw "Accessibility permissions required…" + showed a guidance dialog — it never triggered the macOS system prompt, so the app was never added to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility and users (especially on the unsigned dev Electron build) had to add the binary by hand. `ClipboardManager.requestAccessibilityPermission()` now fires the system prompt once per session on the first paste that needs it (passing `true`, which registers the app in the Accessibility list so granting is a single toggle); guarded so a denied user isn't re-prompted every paste. Added a `_systemPreferences()` test seam + regression tests in `src/whisperwoof/core/clipboard/paste-accessibility.test.ts`.
- **Seamless STT model fallback — no more silent downgrade to `tiny`.** When the selected Whisper model wasn't downloaded, transcription used to fetch/use a worse model (often `tiny`, which can't do Chinese and is weak at English) with no signal — so a bilingual user got garbage and assumed STT was broken. It now transcribes with the best model already on disk (multilingual-first: `turbo → large → medium → small → base`, never silently `tiny`) and tags the result (`requestedModel`/`modelUsed`). Language stays auto-detect, so Chinese is recognized when a multilingual model is present. New pure picker `src/helpers/whisperModelFallback.js` (`pickBestDownloadedModel`), wired in `src/helpers/whisper.js`; tests in `src/whisperwoof/core/stt/model-fallback.test.ts`.

### Added
- **Keyboard-shortcut cheatsheet in Settings → Hotkeys.** The hotkeys page previously taught only the dictation key; `Fn+T` (todo) was surfaced nowhere in-app. Added a read-only, grouped cheatsheet (Core / Routing / Navigation / Focus / Privacy) sourced from `keybindings-pure.js` (`DEFAULT_KEYBINDINGS`) so it can't drift from the real bindings. `src/components/SettingsPage.tsx`.
- **NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v2 (English) STT model.** Added the English-optimized Parakeet v2 (`sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`, ~482 MB) alongside the multilingual v3. Same on-device TDT transducer layout (encoder/decoder/joiner/tokens) as v3, so it drops into the existing sherpa-onnx runtime; URL verified (HTTP 206). `src/models/modelRegistryData.json`.
- **Permissions are now manageable in Settings.** Mic, Accessibility, and System Audio status + grant buttons now live in Settings → Privacy & Data (previously reachable only during onboarding, so a user who denied had no in-app way to see status or re-grant). Reuses the onboarding `PermissionsSection`. The Accessibility troubleshooting copy now warns that the Fn routing shortcuts — not just auto-paste — stop working without it. `src/components/SettingsPage.tsx`, `src/locales/en/translation.json`.
- **Dictation indicator distinguishes Transcribing vs Polishing, with a slow-state hint.** The post-recording indicator previously showed one random dog-pun for the entire STT+polish window, so a long or cold-model run looked identical to a hang. It now shows "Transcribing…" then "Polishing…" (`audioManager` emits a new additive `onProcessingPhase` signal when the reasoning step starts) and, after ~8 s of processing, "Still working…". `src/helpers/audioManager.js`, `src/hooks/useAudioRecording.js`, `src/App.jsx`.
- **Transcription model picker: one click selects-and-downloads, plus language labels.** Clicking a not-yet-downloaded model did nothing — you had to find a separate Download button — so the default `small` model (which isn't bundled) looked selected but never ran, and dictation silently fell back. Now clicking any model card downloads it if needed and activates it when ready (your current model keeps working meanwhile via the STT fallback above). Whisper cards also show a **Multilingual / English** label so a bilingual user doesn't pick an English-only model (e.g. `distil-*`) and lose Chinese. `src/components/TranscriptionModelPicker.tsx`.

### Accessibility
- **Toasts and the dictation indicator are now screen-reader accessible.** The toast viewport is a labeled `role="region"`; each toast is a `role="status"` (or `role="alert"` for errors) live region with `aria-atomic`, so messages (mic denied, offline, copied, polished, …) are announced instead of silent. The floating indicator's status text is a `role="status"` `aria-live="polite"` region, the mic button gets a state-reflective `aria-label`, and the rapidly-updating live-transcript preview is `aria-hidden` to avoid char-by-char spam. `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx`, `src/App.jsx`.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-05-18 — Polish Architecture Consolidation + Speed Wins

### Refactor
- **Consolidated text polish onto OpenWhispr's canonical reasoning path.** WhisperWoof previously shipped a parallel polish stack (Ollama backend, BYOM panel, 5 presets, custom-prompt textbox, free-text model field) layered on top of OpenWhispr's existing Intelligence panel (model picker with downloads, Prompt Studio, llama-server backend). Two overlapping UIs, two overlapping backends, only one of which actually ran on dictation. Removed the duplication: dictation polish now flows through `audioManager.processTranscription` → `ReasoningService.processText` → llama-server, gated by Intelligence > "Enable text cleanup". The "Polish (Ollama)" section is gone from WhisperWoof Settings; cleanup is configured in Intelligence + Prompt Studio.
- **Eliminated double polish.** `useAudioRecording.js` was calling `whisperwoofOllamaPolish` after `audioManager.processTranscription` had already polished the transcript — wasting ~3-4s every dictation on a redundant inference pass. Removed.
- **Routed CommandBar (Cmd+K), file-import, and meeting-end polish through `ReasoningService`.** Three remaining production callers were still on the parallel WhisperWoof Ollama polish stack — `CommandBar.tsx` (`/note` route + default paste-at-cursor) called `whisperwoofOllamaPolish` directly, and the `whisperwoof-import-audio` + `whisperwoof-meeting-end` IPC handlers in `ipcHandlers.js` invoked `polishWithOllama` inline. All three now use the canonical `cleanupPrompt` and the user's `useReasoningModel` setting. CommandBar mirrors `audioManager.processTranscription` directly. The two IPC handlers return raw transcripts and save with `polished: null`, leaving polish as a renderer-layer concern (clean separation: IPC handles audio→text; polish is a UI setting that may not even be enabled). Deleted the now-dead `whisperwoof-ollama-polish` IPC handler and the `whisperwoofOllamaPolish` preload binding. The legacy Ollama polish stack is retained only because `src/whisperwoof/bridge/tuning-bench.js` (dev-only preset-comparison bench) still uses it directly.

### Fixes
- **Reverted overzealous polish prompt rewrite (commit `dddf61f87`).** The added "PARAGRAPH SEPARATION: detect topic changes" and "do NOT collapse" rules caused small Ollama models (`llama3.2:1b/3b`) to duplicate paragraphs, apply random Title Case, prepend "Here is the cleaned-up version:" preambles, and refuse simple inputs. Restored the simpler pre-rewrite prompts; tests now guard against re-introducing the offending rules.
- **Ollama model fallback** in `llm-providers.js` — when the configured Ollama model isn't installed, polish silently 404'd. Now pre-checks `/api/tags` (cached 30s) and falls back to a ranked list of preferred models (`qwen2.5:3b → llama3.2:3b → ... → llama3.2:1b`) with a clear log warning. Bumped Ollama timeout 5s → 15s for cold-start of 1B-3B models on Apple Silicon.

### Performance
- **llama-server pre-warm at startup.** When `sync-startup-preferences` fires (on app boot via `useSettings` mount), if local reasoning is enabled, `modelManager.prewarmServer(modelId)` starts loading the model in parallel with whatever else is happening — saving ~10-15s on the first dictation after launch. Idempotent (`serverManager.start` returns early if already running).
- **Skip polish for short transcripts.** Dictations under 25 characters now short-circuit before the reasoning round-trip — LLM cleanup on text this short usually returns the input unchanged and just adds latency. Tested: a 15-char dictation that previously paid the full polish round-trip (13s cold / ~500ms warm) now skips it entirely. Threshold overridable via `POLISH_SKIP_CHARS` env var.
- **Polish timeout + raw fallback (3s cap).** Wrapped `ReasoningService.processText` in `Promise.race` with a 3s default timeout. On timeout (cold-starting model, stalled provider, etc.), the caller catches and falls back to the raw transcript — better to ship raw fast than block dictation. Threshold overridable via `POLISH_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **Surface env-write persistence failures.** The `_syncStartupEnv` handler was silently catching `saveAllKeysToEnvFile` errors — a real persistence bug observed on 2026-05-17 (user's `.env` hadn't been updated in a month despite reasoning settings being active) was invisible in logs. Replaced `.catch(() => {})` with a `debugLogger.warn` so future failures become diagnosable. When the userData `.env` doesn't get written, every subsequent boot loses pre-warm (main.js gates on `REASONING_PROVIDER` being present).

### Tests
- 53 test files / 963 tests — all green.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-21 — Live Transcript Ticker + Meeting Hotkey Removal

### New Features
- **Live transcript ticker in floating indicator** — when using a streaming STT provider (Deepgram or OpenAI Realtime), the floating indicator now shows your words streaming in real-time as you speak, replacing the static "Listening..." label. Text flows right-to-left with a fade mask — newest words on the right, older words scroll off the left edge. Falls back to "Listening..." for batch mode (local Whisper). Togglable in Settings > WhisperWoof > Indicator > "Show live transcript" (default: ON).

### Fixes
- **Removed meeting hotkey (Cmd+Shift+N conflict)** — the global meeting hotkey conflicted with browser incognito window shortcuts and caused unexpected window resizes. Meeting detection is already automatic via calendar events, process detection, and mic activity — the manual hotkey was redundant. Any previously saved meeting hotkey is cleared on startup. The Meeting Mode Hotkey section has been removed from Settings.

### Tests
- 46 test files / 882 tests — all green.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-14 — Hotkey Fix + Plugin Setup + Obsidian Integration + Zero TS Errors

### New Features
- **Fn+letter key consumption via CGEventTap** — rewrote `macos-globe-listener.swift` from `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` (read-only) to `CGEventTapCreate` with `headInsertEventTap`. When Fn is held, routing key presses (T/N/P) are consumed before reaching the focused app. No more "ttttt" typed into text fields. Falls back to the original read-only monitor if Accessibility permission is not granted.
- **Fn+N now actually saves markdown** — previously Fn+N and Fn+P silently fell through to paste-at-cursor. Both routes now have real dispatch handlers: Fn+N calls `whisperwoofSaveMarkdown` (saves `.md` file with toast confirmation), Fn+P tags entry for project routing.
- **Fn+letter combos force push-to-talk** — regardless of global activation mode (push vs tap/toggle), Fn+letter combos always behave as hold-to-record, release-to-stop. Plain Fn still respects the user's activation mode preference.
- **Guided plugin setup flow** — toggling a plugin ON for the first time shows an inline setup card with instructions, a link to the service's developer portal, a password-masked API key input, and a test button. Works for all 5 first-party plugins.
- **TickTick plugin added** — was missing from the default plugin list despite having permission definitions and MCP server code. Now shows alongside Todoist, Notion, Calendar, and Slack.
- **Markdown notes with YAML frontmatter** — saved notes now include `title`, `date`, `source`, and `app` frontmatter for Obsidian compatibility.
- **Notes directory configurable via UI** — Settings > Notes > "Change Folder" opens a native macOS folder picker. Point to your Obsidian vault or iCloud folder. Persisted in `whisperwoof-settings.json`.
- **Mando head in route toasts** — Fn+T (clipboard), Fn+N (note), Fn+P (project) toasts now show the Mando mascot head as an icon. Toast component gained an `icon` prop.

### Fixes
- **All 15 `debugLogger.error("msg:", error)` sites in `ipcHandlers.js` now log actual error messages** instead of `{}`. Error objects don't JSON-serialize (message/stack aren't enumerable), so every caught error rendered as an empty object.
- **Plugin default list auto-merges** — existing saved plugin files automatically gain new default plugins (like TickTick) and backfill setup metadata on load. No manual reconfiguration needed.

### Refactor
- **Test-truthfulness refactor: 31 of ~35 files done (all buckets complete).** Bucket C: 6 more files wired to real source (`app-automation`, `conversation-memory`, `streaming-manager`, `daily-digest`, `entry-chains`, `entry-templates`). Bucket D: `vad` (Pattern 1) and `telegram-sync` (Pattern 2) refactored. `smart-clipboard` documented as not-feasible (inline SQL needs `better-sqlite3`).
- **TypeScript strict-mode errors: 313 to 0.** Fixed all errors across 30+ files: type annotations on mock objects, non-null assertions on array access, removed 23 stale `@ts-expect-error` directives, added `Window.electronAPI` type declaration, fixed `ModelAdvisor` record access, `TuningBench` DP array types, `SmartClipboard` board color access.

### Tests
- 44 test files / 808 tests (up from 800). Zero regressions.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-12 — Engineering Cleanup + Security Fix + Latency Infra + Upstream Catch-Up

### Website
- **Combined "floating assistant" + "raw voice in, polished text out" demo sections** into one condensed mock-window card with Mando head, waveform, raw input, and polished output all in a single visual. Removed the separate "Meet your floating assistant" preview section.
- **Unified features grid**: removed "Mando's ears" card, converted from mixed 3-column with wide-span cards to a clean 2-column, 4-row grid with 8 equal-size cards.
- **Fixed JS crash**: `querySelector('.demo-box')` returned null after the section merge, crashing the IntersectionObserver setup and breaking all scroll-reveal animations on the entire page.

### Fixes (app)
- **Distil model download broken**: Distil Large V3 and V3.5 were missing `expectedSizeBytes` in the model registry, so the download config computed `NaN` for the file size, breaking disk-space checks and silently aborting the download. Added the numeric field.
- **Wrong provider icon**: all local Whisper models showed the OpenAI ChatGPT logo. Changed to the open-source whisper icon since these are GGML community binaries from `ggerganov/whisper.cpp`, not official OpenAI distributions.

### New Feature: Pipeline Latency Instrumentation (infra)
- **LatencyTracker module** (`src/whisperwoof/core/latency/`) — pure TypeScript class that collects `performance.now()` marks at each pipeline stage. Injectable `Clock` interface so the bench harness and unit tests can use deterministic fake clocks. Typed `PipelineStage` enum (`hotkey` → `micOpen` → `micStop` → `sttStart` → `sttEnd` → `polishStart` → `polishEnd` → `pasteStart` → `pasteEnd`) and a `PipelineTimings` interface for the flat, persistable record.
- **`useAudioRecording.js` instrumented** — a tracker is created on hotkey fire, marked through every stage boundary, and finalized when the capture completes. The full `PipelineTimings` record (speaking duration + STT + polish + paste + perceived latency + total) is now persisted to `bf_entries.metadata.timings` and logged to the console with a PASS/OVER label against the 500ms perceived-latency budget. `durationMs` (previously a TODO null) is now populated with the speaking duration.
- **14 unit tests** covering the full LatencyTracker lifecycle: happy-path capture, polish-skipped capture, snippet-short-circuit capture, negative-duration clamping, partial marks, and the 500ms budget gate.
- **No UI dashboard yet** — display surface will be designed in a follow-up scope discussion. The infra collects and persists; the UI reads later.

### Security
- **Settings export was leaking every API key** (caught by the test-truthfulness refactor). The inline `stripApiKeys` in `bridge/settings-export.js` used `String.includes("apiKey")` (lowercase `a`) as its secret marker. The app stores real keys as `openaiApiKey`, `anthropicApiKey`, `groqApiKey`, `geminiApiKey`, `mistralApiKey`, `customTranscriptionApiKey`, `customReasoningApiKey` in `src/stores/settingsStore.ts` — every one has a capital `A` after the provider name. `"openaiApiKey".includes("apiKey")` returns **false**, so the filter silently matched **none** of the real keys the app writes. Any user who exported their settings got a plaintext dump of every API key they'd configured. Fixed: the pure module now lowercases keys before matching and uses an expanded marker list (`apikey`, `api-key`, `api_key`, `token`, `secret`, `bearer`). The old test hid the bug by testing against a fictitious `"whisperwoof-openai-api-key"` naming convention the app never uses.

### Fixes
- **Language detection regression**: `SCRIPT_PATTERNS` in `bridge/language-detect.js` were declared without the `/g` flag, so `String.match(pattern).length` was always 1 and the `ratio > 0.15` gate never triggered — production `detectLanguage` silently returned English for every non-Latin-script string. Caught by the test-truthfulness refactor.
- **Virtual scroll perf**: `EntryRow` in `WhisperWoofHistory.tsx` was a plain function component with an unstable inline `onSelect` arrow, so every scroll re-rendered every visible row. Wrapped in `React.memo` and pass `setSelectedId` directly (stable by React's `useState` contract).
- **Project integration N+1**: `WhisperWoofProjects.tsx` fired one IPC call per project to fetch integration targets. Replaced with a single batched `whisperwoof-get-project-integrations` handler that returns the full `projectId → target` map in one SQL query.
- **SmartClipboard demo data leak risk**: the IPC-unavailable branch in `SmartClipboard.fetchData` seeded demo boards/snippets. Safe by accident in production but one preload bug away from leaking — now gated behind `import.meta.env.DEV` with a real error message in production.
- **STT config error at boot**: `get-stt-config` threw `"No session cookies available"` on every boot for any user not signed into OpenWhispr cloud — i.e., the whole local-first target audience — and each of three `useAudioRecording` hook instances (dictation / control panel / sidebar) logged the error. The log showed `{}` because `debugLogger.error("msg:", errorObj)` doesn't serialize Error objects (message / stack aren't enumerable). Fixed: "not signed in" is now a clean non-error return, and real errors log `error.message` via template literal. Same `"msg:", error` pattern exists in 17 other places across `ipcHandlers.js` — flagged for a follow-up sweep.

### Refactor
- **Deleted unused `SqliteProvider` class** (636 lines). The runtime has always used `better-sqlite3` directly in `bridge/app-init.js`; the class was only imported by its own (now-deleted) test file. Corrected `CLAUDE.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` to describe the actual architecture.
- **Test-truthfulness refactor, 23 of ~35 files**: ~35 test files previously defined their own inline copies of production logic, so regressions in real code would ship green. 23 files now import from the real source — either via direct import (when the bridge module is load-safe) or by extracting a `*-pure.js` sibling (when the bridge crashes at load because of top-level `app.getPath`). Files wired: `snippet-hotkeys`, `context-detector`, `snippets`, `style-learner`, `privacy-lock`, `backtrack`, `language-detect`, `llm-providers`, `voice-commands`, `smart-reply`, `vibe-coding`, `recurring-capture`, `settings-export`, `webhooks`, `analytics`, `focus-mode`, `entry-tags`, `auto-tagger`, `semantic-search`, `screen-context`, `keybindings`, `intent-capture`, `vocabulary`. **Bucket B and Bucket C batches 1–4 are complete.** Remaining 12 files tracked in `docs/test-truthfulness-refactor.md`.
- Extracted `validateConfig(config)` as a pure exported helper in `bridge/llm-providers.js`; `polishWithProvider` now delegates to it instead of duplicating the registry lookup and API-key gate inline.
- **Webhook security helpers now live in one place.** `buildPayload`, `signPayload` (HMAC-SHA256), `matchesFilters`, and `validateWebhookUrl` moved from inline copies inside `bridge/webhooks.js` into `bridge/webhooks-pure.js`. Production delegates; tests import the real helpers. Added explicit SSRF-guard assertions against `file://` / `data:` / `ftp://` URLs plus a hand-computed HMAC baseline so any future change to the signing algorithm or serialization trips the suite.
- **Analytics math now shared**: `computePolishStats`, `computeStreaks`, `fillHourGaps`, `extractCommandName`, `extractSnippetTrigger`, `getEmptyDashboard` moved to `bridge/analytics-pure.js`. Production SQL queries fetch raw rows from `bf_entries`, then hand them to the pure helpers. Tests exercise the same math instead of a parallel JS re-implementation.
- **Focus-mode transformations are pure.** `SPRINT_PRESETS`, `validateDuration`, `createSessionObject`, `appendEntryToSession`, `markSessionEnded`, `computeFocusStats`, `computeActiveSessionView` moved to `bridge/focus-mode-pure.js`. `bridge/focus-mode.js` keeps the module-level `activeSession` + disk persistence but every session transformation goes through the pure module. Tests now assert deterministic behavior by passing explicit `now` timestamps.
- **Entry-tag validation unified.** `validateTagName` + `DEFAULT_TAG_COLOR` + `MAX_TAG_NAME_LENGTH` moved to `bridge/entry-tags-pure.js`. Production `createTag` / `updateTag` delegate. Dropped the previous in-memory mock tests (`isUnique`, `getEntriesByTag`, `getEntryTags`, `computeStats`) since production is SQL-only and those tests were asserting against a parallel JavaScript re-implementation, not real behavior.
- **Bucket C batch 2 wired 3 load-safe bridge modules via direct import** (no `-pure.js` extraction needed, same pattern as earlier `context-detector` / `voice-commands` / `smart-reply`): `auto-tagger` (keyword rule matching + `KEYWORD_RULES` registry), `semantic-search` (TF-IDF `tokenize`/`termFrequency`/`inverseDocumentFrequency`/`tfidfVector`/`cosineSimilarity` + `STOP_WORDS`), `screen-context` (`detectScreenCommand` + the 6-command `SCREEN_COMMANDS` registry). All three already exported every pure helper — the old tests just never imported them. Added a new regression guard for screen-command vs voice-command disambiguation so a future regex change to one side can't silently start shadowing the other.
- **Bucket C batch 3**: `keybindings` (Pattern 2 — extracted `DEFAULT_KEYBINDINGS` / `CATEGORIES` / `KEY_COMBO_PATTERN` / `isValidKeyCombo` / `mergeWithOverrides` / `detectConflict` / `validateKeybindingBundle` into `bridge/keybindings-pure.js`; production `rebindAction` and `importKeybindings` now delegate), `intent-capture` (Pattern 1 direct import — `detectRambling`, `getIntentPrompt`, `getOutputModes`, `RAMBLING_SIGNALS`, `OUTPUT_MODES`). Added a new assertion that every `RAMBLING_SIGNALS` entry carries the `/g` flag — without it `String.match` would return only the first hit and the density heuristic would silently underreport (same class of bug as the `language-detect` regression caught in batch 2).
- **Bucket C batch 4**: `vocabulary` (Pattern 2 — extracted `filterVocabulary` / `isDuplicateWord` / `flattenSttHints` / `computeVocabularyStats` / `planVocabularyImport` / `MAX_ENTRIES` into `bridge/vocabulary-pure.js`). Production `getVocabulary` / `addWord` / `importWords` / `getSttHints` / `getVocabularyStats` now delegate. `planVocabularyImport` takes `nowIso` and `idFactory` as dependency-injected arguments so tests can be deterministic — this is the first of the pure extractions to need explicit time/id injection, a good template for the remaining Pattern 2 files that generate timestamped records.

### Upstream catch-up (cherry-picked from `OpenWhispr/openwhispr`)
Full upstream merge deferred to its own session (182 commits behind, heavy overlap on `ipcHandlers.js` / agent / meeting components). These five additive commits landed cleanly:
- **Security**: `brace-expansion` 1.1.13 security backport
- **Security**: `@xmldom/xmldom` 0.8.12 bump
- **Security**: `JSON.parse` result type-validation in `src/config/prompts.ts` custom prompt loader
- **Local models**: Gemma 4 E2B + E4B added to the local model registry (+ translations)
- **Local models**: Gemma 4 31B + 26B MoE added to the local model registry (+ translations)

### Tests
- 44 test files / 800 tests (up from 744 — net gain from real-source assertions in the refactored tests + 14 new latency tracker tests; zero regressions)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-08 — Meeting Safety + Agent Fixes + Reliable Detection

### Meeting Recording — Crash-Safe Audio
- **Local audio buffer** — mic + system audio written to 5-minute rotating WAV files on disk. Network drop or crash no longer loses meeting audio.
- **Transcript checkpoints** — partial transcript saved to SQLite every 60 seconds. At most 60s of transcript lost on failure.
- **WebSocket reconnection** — automatic reconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 16s) when OpenAI Realtime stream drops.
- **Session rotation** — proactively rotates WebSocket at 25 minutes to avoid OpenAI's ~30-minute session limit.
- **Auto-start option** — new `meetingAutoStart` setting to begin recording automatically when a meeting is detected.
- **Unified meeting bridge** — replaced in-memory-only segment accumulation with checkpoint-backed persistence.

### Meeting Detection — Granola-Style Reliability
- **Persistent notifications** — meeting prompt stays on screen until user acts (removed 30-second auto-dismiss).
- **Calendar pre-notification** — shows custom overlay ~90 seconds before scheduled meetings, not just at start time.
- **Unified notification path** — calendar events now use the same custom overlay with Start/Dismiss buttons (replaced easy-to-miss native OS notification).
- **Confidence-based thresholds** — 2-second mic threshold when Zoom/Teams/Webex detected running, 8-second threshold otherwise (reduces false positives from Siri, voice search).
- **Calendar overrides cooldown** — imminent calendar event bypasses the 5-minute dismiss cooldown.
- **Process detection feeds audio detector** — running meeting apps lower the sustained audio threshold for faster detection.

### Agent Mode — Bug Fixes
- **Conversation race condition fixed** — rapid speech no longer creates duplicate conversations (mutex guard).
- **LLM streaming cancellation** — "New Chat" and close now abort in-flight LLM requests via AbortController.
- **Smart auto-scroll** — chat only scrolls to bottom when user is near the bottom (within 120px). Reading history during streaming no longer jumps.
- **Stale message ref fixed** — LLM context now always includes the current user message.
- **Agentic actions tests fixed** — tests now import from source module instead of duplicating the implementation (tests had already diverged).

### Polish
- **UpcomingMeetings "Now" indicator** — updates every 30 seconds instead of never refreshing after mount.
- **Deduplicated AgentState type** — exported from AgentOverlay, imported by AgentInput.
- **Empty streaming state** — shows loading dots instead of an empty bubble with a blinking cursor.

### Tests
- 744 tests across 43 files (was 729). 78 new meeting tests + 15 new agentic action tests. Zero regressions.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-06 — Voice Style + Memory + Eval System + STT Providers

### Voice Style (Pipeline Tuning)
- **Voice Style bench** — record audio, compare STT models × polish presets × LLMs side-by-side
- **Audio playback** — play back recorded samples before running comparisons
- **Ideal output scoring** — type what perfect output looks like, variants scored via WER

### Eval System
- **Thumbs up/down** on every transcription in history — builds a personal quality dataset
- **Persistent eval sets** — rated entries saved with audio to `~/.config/WhisperWoof/eval-audio/`
- **Benchmark mode** — load eval set in Voice Style, test new configs against known-good samples

### Memory (Context-Aware Vocabulary)
- **Per-app vocabulary** — tracks which words you use in VS Code vs Slack vs Mail
- **Auto-learn from corrections** — edit a transcript and Memory learns the right word
- **Activity heatmap** — GitHub-style contribution graph on the home page

### New Local STT Models
- **Distil-Whisper Large V3** — 6x faster than Large V3, within 1% WER, 756MB (English-optimized)
- **Distil-Whisper Large V3.5** — latest distilled model, best speed/quality ratio, 756MB
- Both are GGML format, work with existing whisper.cpp server — no new runtime needed
- 8 total local models: tiny, base, small, medium, large, turbo, distil-large-v3, distil-large-v3.5

### UX Polish
- **Custom modes** — create your own polish presets with custom prompts (Superwhisper's $249 feature, free)
- **Sidebar cleanup** — grouped into Primary / Tools / System sections
- **Compact indicator** — full/compact/dot modes for the floating widget
- **Model auto-download** — missing whisper model triggers automatic download of tiny (75MB)
- **Storage Manager** — disk usage, batch delete with confirmation, export, orphan cleanup
- **Fun processing verbs** — "Fetching your words...", "Sniffing out the meaning..."
- **Home page redesign** — greeting, hero stat, activity heatmap, fun facts

### Performance
- **Memory reduced from ~5GB to ~200MB** — whisper-server idle timeout, background throttling, stale process cleanup
- **Multi-monitor widget** — follows cursor to correct display dynamically

### Fixes
- IPC channel collision between voice snippets and Smart Clipboard
- Retry transcription now works after downloading models

- **Internationalization**: Added 15 missing i18n keys (`app.mic.*`, `app.commandMenu.*`, `app.toasts.*`, `app.oauth.*`, `notes.enhance.title`) across all 10 locale files

### Fixed

- **Windows Blank Screen**: Fixed blank screen on return from sleep/minimize by adding `render-process-gone` handler, `isCrashed()` health checks on show/tray/second-instance paths, `backgroundColor` and `backgroundThrottling` to window config, and `disable-gpu-compositing` for win32
- **IPC Echo Loop**: Broke infinite IPC bounce in floating icon auto-hide toggle by guarding the setter with an early return when the value hasn't changed
- **GPU Banner Navigation**: GPU banner "Enable GPU" button now navigates to the correct `"intelligence"` settings section instead of invalid `"reasoning"` ID
- **AI CTA Deep Link**: Replaced legacy `"aiModels"` alias with canonical `"intelligence"` section ID in the AI enhancement CTA button
- **Custom Endpoint Routing** (#311): Moved `reasoningProvider === "custom"` check to the top of `getModelProvider()` so custom endpoint models are never misrouted through built-in providers; custom models now show a neutral Globe icon
- **KDE Wayland Terminal Detection**: Detect Konsole via `kdotool` (fast path) or KWin `supportInformation` via `qdbus` (zero-install fallback) so terminals receive `Ctrl+Shift+V` instead of `Ctrl+V`

- **Usage Cache Invalidation**: `useUsage` hook now listens for `usage-changed` events to invalidate its cache and refetch immediately after transcription
- **macOS Binary Architecture**: Added Mach-O header verification to globe-listener and fast-paste build scripts; force rebuild when architecture-specific hash file is missing; runtime architecture check before spawning binary
- **Globe Key Listener Resilience**: Auto-restart globe key listener on unexpected exit code 0 (sleep/wake invalidation); reset restart counter after sustained uptime; only treat "Failed to create event tap" as fatal
- **Parakeet Long Recordings**: Lowered max segment duration from 30s to 15s for more reliable chunked transcription; downgraded reasoning failure log from error to warn

## [1.0.13] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- Enhanced Linux support with Wayland compatibility, multiple package formats (AppImage, deb, rpm, Flatpak), and native window controls
- Auto-detect existing Python during onboarding and gate the installer with a recheck option
- "Use Existing Python" skip flow to onboarding with confirmation dialog

### Changed

- Reuse audio manager and stabilize dictation toggle callback to fix recording latency
- Add cleanup functions to IPC listeners to prevent memory leaks
- Make Flatpak opt-in for local builds only

### Fixed

- Optimized transcription pipeline with caching, batched reads, and non-blocking operations for improved performance
- Reference error in settings page

- Add Linux packaging dependencies to GitHub Actions workflow

## [1.0.12] - 2025-11-13

### Added

- Added `scripts/complete-uninstall.sh` plus a new TROUBLESHOOTING guide so you can collect arch diagnostics, clean caches, and reset permissions before reinstalling stubborn builds.
- Control Panel history now auto-refreshes through a shared store and IPC events, so new, deleted, or cleared transcripts sync instantly without a manual refresh.
- Distribution artifacts now include both Apple Silicon and Intel macOS DMG/ZIP outputs, and the README documents Debian/Ubuntu packaging along with optional `xdotool` support.

### Changed

- The onboarding flow now validates dictation hotkeys before letting you continue, remembers whether cloud auth was skipped, and only persists sanitized API keys once supplied.
- History entries normalize timestamps and no longer run the removed legacy text cleanup helper, so the UI shows the exact Whisper output that was saved.

### Fixed

- Local Whisper now finds Python on Windows more reliably by scanning typical install paths, honoring `OPENWHISPR_PYTHON`, and surfacing actionable ENOENT guidance.
- Whisper installs automatically retry pip operations that hit PEP‑668, TOML, or permission errors, sanitizing the output and falling back to `--user` + legacy resolver when needed.

## [1.0.11] - 2025-10-13

### Added

- Settings, onboarding, and the AI model selector now accept OpenAI-compatible custom base URLs for both transcription and reasoning providers, complete with validation and reset helpers.
- Windows now gets full tray behavior: closing the control panel hides it to the tray, left-click reopens it, and the UI adds a native close button.

### Changed

- ReasoningService sends both `input` and `messages` payloads and automatically falls back between `/responses` and `/chat/completions` so older OpenAI-compatible endpoints keep working.

### Fixed

- Successful endpoint detection is cached per base URL, so the app remembers whether to call `/responses` or `/chat/completions` instead of retrying the wrong path forever.
- Custom endpoint fields now enforce HTTPS (with localhost as the lone exception) across the UI and services, preventing API keys from ever leaving over plain HTTP.

## [1.0.10] - 2025-10-07

### Added

- Added a `compile:globe` build step that emits a macOS Globe listener binary into `resources/bin` before every dev, pack, or dist command so the hotkey ships with all builds.

### Fixed

- Globe key failures now raise a macOS dialog, verify the bundled binary is executable, and kill/restart the listener cleanly so the shortcut survives packaging.

## [1.0.9] - 2025-10-07

### Changed

- Simplified the release workflow by removing the bespoke GitHub release job and letting electron-builder upload draft releases directly.

## [1.0.8] - 2025-10-03

### Fixed

- Globe/Fn hotkey reliability improved by showing the dictation panel before toggling, making focus optional, and surfacing listener spawn errors instead of failing silently.

## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-03

### Added

- Settings update controls now show download progress bars, install countdowns, and clearer messaging while fetching or installing new builds.

### Changed

- Auto-update internals now track listeners, cache the last release metadata, and keep auto-download/auto-install disabled until the user explicitly triggers an update, eliminating the previous memory leaks.

### Fixed

- `Install & Restart` now emits `before-quit`, enables `autoInstallOnAppQuit`, logs progress, and calls `quitAndInstall(false, true)` so updates actually apply when quitting or pressing the button.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-11

### Added

- **Dictation Panel Command Menu**: Clicking the floating panel reveals quick actions, including a one-click "Hide this for now" option.
- **macOS Globe Key Support**: Added a lightweight Swift listener so the Globe/Fn key can toggle dictation across the system.
- **Globe Key Selection UI**: Settings and onboarding keyboards now include a dedicated Globe key option.
- **Hotkey Validation**: Settings and onboarding now verify shortcut registration immediately, alerting users when a key can’t be bound.
- **Model Cache Cleanup**: Added an in-app command (and installer/uninstaller hooks) to delete all cached Whisper models.
- **Tray Controls**: macOS tray menu gained quick actions to show or hide the dictation panel.

### Changed

- **Dictation Overlay Placement**: Window now anchors to the active workspace's bottom-right corner with a safety margin, preventing it from sliding off-screen on multi-monitor setups.
- **Dictation Overlay Canvas**: Enlarged the floating window so tooltips, menus, and error states render without being clipped while keeping click-through behaviour outside interactive elements.
- **Keyboard UX**: Virtual keyboard hides macOS-exclusive keys on Windows/Linux and standardises hotkey labels.

### Fixed

- **macOS Window Lifecycle**: Ensured the dictation panel keeps the app visible in Dock and Command-Tab while retaining floating behaviour across spaces.
- **Control Panel Stability**: Reworked close/minimize handling so the panel stays interactive when switching apps and reopens cleanly without spawning duplicate windows.
- **Always-On-Top Enforcement**: Centralised the logic that reapplies floating window levels, eliminating redundant timers and focus quirks.
- **Menu Labelling**: macOS application menu items now display the correct OpenWhispr casing instead of "open-whispr".
- **Non-mac Hotkey Guard**: Prevented the mac-only Globe shortcut from being saved on Windows/Linux.
