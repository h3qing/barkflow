/**
 * Fn press-and-hold / double-tap-latch state machine — pure.
 *
 * Push-to-talk with a hands-free latch, Wispr-Flow style:
 *
 *   hold Fn, speak, release          -> transcript pastes (classic push-to-talk)
 *   double-tap Fn                    -> recording latches on, hands free
 *   tap Fn while latched             -> stop + paste
 *   single lone tap                  -> depends on `loneTap` (see below)
 *
 * The machine drives BOTH activation modes; they differ only in what a lone
 * tap (no second tap inside the double-tap window) means:
 *
 *   loneTap: "latch"   ("Tap" mode)  the tap latches recording on — tap to
 *                                    start, tap again to stop, exactly what
 *                                    tap-to-toggle users expect, plus hold
 *                                    and double-tap for free.
 *   loneTap: "cancel"  ("Hold" mode) the tap is an accident: the recording
 *                                    is discarded and nothing pastes.
 *
 * The latency-critical property: a press held longer than `tapMaxMs` is a
 * HOLD, and its release stops + processes immediately — the double-tap
 * window only ever delays taps shorter than that, so normal dictation gains
 * zero latency. And because recording starts `minHoldMs` after the FIRST
 * press, a double-tap latch loses none of the opening words.
 *
 * Pure on purpose (the repo's truthfulness pattern): no timers, no Date —
 * the caller owns the clock. Every input returns a list of actions; timers
 * are requested via an `armTimer` action and delivered back through
 * `fire(id, now)`. All timing paths are unit-testable. The activation mode
 * is read by the caller and passed per press, so a settings change takes
 * effect on the very next key-down without rebuilding the machine.
 *
 * Actions emitted:
 *   showPanel                       show the dictation overlay
 *   startRecording                  begin capture
 *   stopAndProcess                  stop capture and run the pipeline
 *   cancelRecording                 discard capture, nothing pastes
 *   hidePanel                       hide the overlay
 *   armTimer {id, delayMs}          call fire(id, now) after delayMs
