/**
 * Deterministic guard on LLM cleanup output — the last line of defense
 * against a polish model pasting its own deliberation into the user's text.
 *
 * Observed in the wild (Qwen3.5 2B): raw "…如果架构合适的话…" came back as the
 * cleaned sentence PLUS 300 characters of the model discussing whether 架构
 * was a typo ("注：原文中"架构"为误写… 修正后：…"). `<think>` stripping and
 * `enable_thinking: false` already exist upstream of this — but inline
 * meta-commentary is plain text and no tag strip can catch it.
 *
 * Four independent, deterministic checks, all judged AGAINST THE RAW INPUT so
 * legitimately dictated words can never trip them:
 *
 *  1. Growth: cleanup removes fillers and fixes punctuation — it never
 *     multiplies the text. Output longer than GROWTH_RATIO x input (plus a
 *     fixed slack for punctuation/number expansion) is not a cleanup.
 *  2. Language flip: a mostly-Chinese input can never come back with almost
 *     no Han characters (or the reverse) — that is a translation, also
 *     observed in production ("Pizzo,你知不知道…" -> pure English). The same
 *     check also catches PARTIAL translation (one clause flipped): losing a
 *     chunk of one script while gaining the other in proportion.
 *  3. Emote: a reply that is just "*punch*" is the model roleplaying, unless
 *     the user dictated the asterisks (literally or as 星号/asterisk).
 *  4. Meta markers: a short, high-precision list of phrases a cleanup model
 *     uses to talk ABOUT the text (注：, 修正后：, "Here is the cleaned"…).
 *     Only counted when the RAW text does not itself contain the marker.
 *
 * On rejection the caller pastes the raw transcript: what the user actually
 * said always beats what a model wanted to say about it.
